# Spam-Detection-ML
A spam email classifier using Python and TensorFlow with NLP techniques. It preprocesses text using TF-IDF vectorization and classifies messages with Logistic Regression. The model is trained on labeled spam and non-spam data.
Key Features
	• Data Preprocessing: Converts text to lowercase, removes stopwords, and tokenizes words
	• TF-IDF Vectorization: Transforms email text into numerical features
	• Model Training: Uses Logistic Regression for classification
	• Evaluation: Measures accuracy to assess model performance
This model helps automate spam filtering, improving email security by identifying unwanted messages. It can be integrated into email systems for real-time spam detection.
